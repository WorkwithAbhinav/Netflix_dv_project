# Netflix Data Visualization

This project focuses on visualizing Netflix data to gain insights into the top 10 watched movies. It involves importing the necessary libraries, loading the dataset, removing unnecessary columns, and visualizing the data for a better understanding of popular movies.

## Project Structure

The project comprises the following key steps:

### 1. Importing Libraries

The Python code utilizes various libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. Some of the main libraries used are Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

### 2. Importing Data

The dataset containing Netflix movie information is imported. It includes details such as movie titles, genres, release years, and viewer ratings.

### 3. Removing Unnecessary Columns

To focus solely on the top watched movies, irrelevant columns that do not contribute to the analysis are removed. This step ensures a streamlined dataset tailored for the visualization process.

### 4. Visualizing Top 10 Watched Movies

The dataset is processed to identify and visualize the top 10 watched movies. Visualization techniques such as bar charts, pie charts, or other suitable methods are employed to present this information effectively.
